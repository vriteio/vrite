          </p>
          <p>
            This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of title.
            This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of

            Vrite at any time.{" "}

            you submit to us for publication on our website. We will never claim
            ownership of your content, but we do require a license from you in

          <p>
            The license you grant us can be terminated at any time by deleting

          <h3>Liability</h3>
          <p>
            Our website and the materials on our website are provided on an 'as
            is' basis. To the extent permitted by law, Vrite makes no
            warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates
            all other warranties including, without limitation, implied
            warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a
            particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property, or
            other violation of rights.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            In no event shall Vrite or its suppliers be liable for any
            consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third party
            arising from the use or inability to use this website or the
            materials on this website, even if Vrite or an authorized
            representative has been notified, orally or in writing, of the
            possibility of such damage.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            In the context of this agreement, &ldquo;consequential loss&rdquo;
            includes any consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated
            loss of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business,
            loss of goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of
            reputation, loss of use and/or loss or corruption of data, whether
            under statute, contract, equity, tort (including negligence),
            indemnity, or otherwise.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
            warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
            incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.{" "}
          </p>

            otherwise relating to such materials or on any resources linked to
            this website.{" "}

          </p>
          <h3>Severance</h3>
          <p>
            Any term of these Terms of Service which is wholly or partially void
            or unenforceable is severed to the extent that it is void or
            unenforceable. The validity of the remainder of these Terms of
            Service is not affected.{" "}
          </p>
          <h3>Governing Law</h3>
