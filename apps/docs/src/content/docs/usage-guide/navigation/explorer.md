The right-side **explorer** is a special panel you can use to manage your Vrite content, even right beside the editor. It’s also the best and only place to manage **nested content** in Vrite.

## Navigating with the Explorer

The Explorer panel can be used to navigate between both content pieces and content groups (including nested ones).

- Click the _folder_ icon or the content group name to open the selected content group in the dashboard;
- Click the _document_ icon or the content piece name to open the selected content pieces in the editor;
- Click your workspace’s name at the very top to open the top level (_root_) of your workspace in the dashboard;

Use the _chevron_ button to expand or collapse content groups without selecting them.

## Content Group Menu

Each content group entry in the Explorer panel has a dedicated menu with the following options:

- _Copy ID_ — copy the ID of the given content group;
- _Rename group_ — rename the content group right from the panel;
- _New content piece_ — create a new content piece inside the content group;
- _New group_ — create a new **nested content group** inside the given group;
- _Delete_ — delete the content group, including all the nested groups and pieces;

## Content Piece Menu

The Explorer panel uniquely provides a simple menu for every content piece. From the menu, you can quickly take the following actions (without even selecting the content piece):

- _Rename piece_ — change the title of the given content piece, right from the panel;
- _Delete_ — delete the content piece;
