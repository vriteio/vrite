With Vrite’s unique features like Kanban-based content management, the actual publishing flow is quite unique. All you have to do to publish a piece can be just drag and drop.

## Dedicated Content Group

The recommended approach is to create a **dedicated**, ideally **locked**, **content group** for publishing, with an easily-identifiable name e.g. _Published_. You can then move any content piece that's ready to be published, to this content group.

You can then access all the content pieces from this group using either [the API](https://generator.swagger.io/?url=https://api.vrite.io/swagger.json) or the [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/vriteio/sdk-js). You can also set up automatic publishing by creating dedicated Webhooks that send messages to your server whenever an event is triggered by the given content group.

## Publishing with Vrite Extensions

Vrite Extensions simplify the setup process you have to go through to publish your content pieces to popular platforms like [Dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), or [Medium](https://medium.com/). All you have to do is install the Extension and a custom Webhook handling auto-publishing will be added for you. Additionally, you’ll also be able to publish manually from the Extension’s Content Piece View. You can learn more about Vrite Extensions [here](/vrite-extensions).
