Everything related to configuring Vrite can be done from the settings side panel. From managing API tokens to customizing the editing experience — all can be managed in the settings.

It’s worth noting that there are 2 categories of settings in Vrite:

- **Workspace-bound** — settings that are configured for the entire workspace. When configured, all the members of the workspace will see them in effect;
- **User-bound** — personal settings of the user that affect only his own experience and how he is seen by other users, across all workspaces; These include _Profile_, _Appearance,_ and _Security_ settings;

## Managing API Tokens

To access any data from Vrite through the API you’ll need an API access token. You can create and manage those in the _API_ section of the settings.

![API section in Vrite settings](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/s4pf9FbpjpjGAJlBf8vzN.png)

From here you can:

- View a list of created API tokens, along with their names and descriptions;
- Create new API tokens (_New API token_ button in the top-right)
- Edit existing API tokens (_Edit_ button on the token card)
- Delete existing API tokens (_Delete_ button on the token card)

### Creating and Updating API Tokens

When creating or updating a token, you can customize its name, description, and permissions.

![Updating an API token in Vrite](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/J1v8BL7PrdYORrU4V-UfZ.png)

To finalize the action you can click the _Create API token_ or _Update API_ token button in the top-right corner. When the token is first created, its value will appear in a dedicated, topmost card. **Store it securely**, as you’ll **only see it once**.

When updating an existing token, you can also regenerate it using the _Regenerate token_ button. A new, regenerated key will appear in the same way as it does when creating an entirely new token. **Be careful though** — upon regeneration, the previous key will become invalid.

### Token Permission

Permissions are the most important details when configuring an API token. They dictate what API endpoints one can and can’t access with the given token.

Every token permission has 3 levels:

- **No Access** — default, blocks any access to related API endpoints;
- **Read** — allows access to retrieving the data from the API (mostly through related `GET` endpoints);
- **Write** — allows full access (both read and write) to all related endpoints;

The following token permissions are available in Vrite:

- **Content pieces** — access the JSON content and manage detailed content piece metadata (including tags);
- **Content groups** — access and manage content groups and the IDs of related content pieces;
- **Tags** — access and manage tags;
- **User settings** — access and manage your personal UI settings;
- **Roles** — access and manage roles in the workspace;
- **Webhooks** — access and manage Webhooks;
- **Profile** (read-only) — access your personal profile settings;
- **Workspace members** — access and manage workspace members;
- **Workspace** — access the workspace profile and manage its editing settings;

For security, it’s highly recommended that you always pick the minimum permission set required for the token.

API tokens are **bound to the workspace** you’re currently in and visible to other team members. That said, permissions related to personal settings — like _User settings_ and _Profile_ — retrieve details of the user who first created or most recently regenerated the token.

## Managing Webhooks

After API tokens, Webhooks are the second most important way of handling content delivery with Vrite. They allow you to create custom actions, reacting to different events, like a content piece being moved to a different group or a new member being added to a workspace. They can be managed in the _Webhooks_ section.

![Webhooks settings section in Vrite](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/c-dsEYC-EMbMEpu3LTm7r.png)

From the main list, you can reconfigure (using the _Edit_ button) or delete (using the _Delete_ button) any available Webhook. You can also create a new one using the _New Webhook_ button in the top-right corner.

Here’s a list of options you can (or have to) configure when creating or updating a Webhook:

- _Name_ — a distinctive name for the Webhook; Required, max 50 characters;
- _Description_ — more details about the Webhook;
- Target URL — URL to send a `POST` request to when the given event occurs; Required, must start with `https://`;
- _Trigger Event_ — one of the available events the Webhook should be triggered for;
- _Content Group_ — the content group the Webhook event should be triggered for; Only applicable for selected events;

![Updating an existing Webhook](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/0ctu6EYcrDEDVJkQs7kns.png)

### Webhook Events

The available Webhook events are split into 3 groups — for **content pieces**, **content groups**, and **members**.

---

The **content piece events** are triggered when a certain event occurs in relation to the content pieces in the selected content group. Available events are:

- _New content piece added_ — a new content piece was created inside or moved into the given content group;
- _Content piece updated_ — the metadata of a content piece in the given content group was updated;
- _Content piece removed_ — a content piece was deleted or moved into a different content group;

Here’s a TypeScript-based interface for the payload that will be received in the body of the `POST` request for any content piece event:

```typescript
interface ContentPieceEventPayload {
  id: string;
  date?: string | null;
  title: string;
  description?: string | null;
  tags: string[];
  members: string[];
  coverUrl?: string | null;
  coverAlt?: string | null;
  contentGroupId: string;
  customData?: Record<string, any> | null;
  canonicalLink?: string | null;
  slug: usage-guide/string;
  locked?: boolean;
}
```

---

The content group events are triggered when the entire content group is affected. Available events are:

- _New content group added_ — a new content group was created;
- _Content group removed_ — an existing content group was deleted;

The payload interface:

```typescript
interface ContentGroupEventPayload {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  locked?: boolean;
}
```

---

The member events are triggered when workspace memberships are edited. Available events are:

- _New member invited_ — a new member invite was sent;
- _New member added _— an invite was accepted and a member was added to the workspace;
- _Member removed_ — member left or was removed from the workspace;

The payload interface:

```typescript
interface MemberEventPayload {
  id: string;
  userId?: string; // Available after the invite is accepted
  roleId: string;
  email?: string; // Available until the invite is accepted
  name?: string; // Available until the invite is accepted
}
```

## Configuring Your Profile

When working in a team, or creating your “About me” page, you’ll need some details about your personal profile. In Vrite, these can be configured in the _Profile_ section of the settings.

![Profile section of the Vrite settings](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/1zzCUNdoM6yMThM_FHSVs.png)

The following profile details can be customized:

- _Avatar_ — your personal avatar; Visible in the dashboard and editor when collaborating in real-time;
- _Full Name_ — your (preferably real) full name; Used across Vrite in place or in addition to your username; It has 50 character limit;
- _Bio_ — additional details about you that can be retrieved through the API;

On top of the profile details you can also update your Vrite credentials, including:

- _Email address_ — used for various communications (like password changes or magic links) and log in; Changing it will require confirmation via an email link, from both your previous and newly-changed email; Before that happens the change is not applied;
- _Username_ — a required, short, recognizable name for use across Vrite; It can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores and has 20 character limit;
- Password — can be changed in the separate _Security_ section of the settings;

When you’re finished with your changes, click _Update_ in the top-right corner to save them.

## Customizing UI Appearance

If you want to personalize the Vrite UI a bit, you can do so in the _Appearance_ section. Here you can pick your main _UI theme_ and _Code editor theme_ as one of _Dark_, _Light_ or _Auto_ (dependent on the system settings).

You can also pick from one of six available _Accent colors_ — to customize important UI elements.

You’ll see the changes applied immediately so that you can visually pick your preferred configuration.

![Vrite appearance settings](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/i4BqNUDNLGMdtWSCm_ouu.png)

## Changing the Password

The security of your password is very important, as it guards access to your entire Vrite account. In case you forget it or learn that it was leaked, you can always change it in the _Security_ section.

![The Security settings](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/VfQOl7ITlX8ADe5qupcnu.png)

To change the password provide both your current and new password and submit with the _Update password_ button. Before the change takes effect, you’ll have to confirm it using a verification link sent to your email address.

## Managing Workspace

The _Workspace_ section to the go-to place for managing your team. Here you can customize basic details about the Workspace, invite new members, and configure their permissions in the Workspace.

![The Workspace settings section](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/jXRKrAh5Kc56mkVa4O81K.png)

At the very top, you can configure Workspace details including:

- _Logo_ — custom logo image for the Workspace;
- _Workspace Name_ — the name of the Workspace;
- _Description_ — additional details about the Workspace;

When you’re finished editing, save the details using the _Update_ button in the top-right corner.

In case you want to delete the entire Workspace (**a very dangerous action**) use the _Delete_ button from the side panel’s top-right dropdown menu.

### Managing Roles

Under _Roles,_ you can see a list of all the roles available in the Workspace. Two roles are created by default and cannot be edited:

- **Viewer** — role with no permissions; Can only preview the information in the Workspace;
- **Admin** — role with all permissions; Assigned by default to the one who originally created the Workspace; At all times, there has to be **at least one Admin** in the Workspace;

All other roles listed can be edited (by clicking the _Edit_ button) or deleted (by clicking the _Delete_ button). You can also create new roles by clicking _New role_ in the top-right corner.

![Creating a new role](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/b4JQTHzsG3Z96o9BoCdXD.png)

When configuring a role, you have to provide a _Role name_ and an optional description of the role. Apart from that, you need to configure the role’s permissions.

The assigned permissions determine what actions will the user who’s been assigned the role be able to take. The available permissions are:

- **Edit content** — for editing content pieces’ content in the editor;
- **Edit metadata** — for editing content pieces’ metadata in the metadata side panel;
- **Manage dashboard** — for creating, moving, and deleting content pieces in the dashboard;
- **Manage API tokens** — for creating, editing, deleting, and regenerating API tokens in the _API_ section of the settings;
- **Manage Webhooks** — for creating, editing, and deleting Webhooks in the Webhooks section of the settings;
- **Manage Workspace** — the most powerful permission; Allows for managing roles, members, and the editing experience in the Workspace; The user with this permission can change his own role further and even delete the entire Workspace;

It’s recommended to assign the minimum required set of permissions to any given role.

### Managing Members

Under _Members,_ you can see a list of all the members in the Workspace, along with their names, full names (if available), and assigned roles.

Having the necessary permissions, you can change a member’s role to any one of the available (by using the select menu) or remove him entirely (using the _Remove_ button). You can also leave the Workspace yourself (using the _Leave_ button).

To add new members to a Workspace you have to invite them first (by clicking _Invite member_).

![Inviting a new member in Vrite](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/2YeG8v9xYE6D7QS1MZ_-l.png)

To send an invite, you’ll have to provide:

- _Name_ — how to refer to the potential new member in an invite; When the invite is accepted, this name will be replaced by the user’s actual username or full name (if available);
- _Email address_ — where to send the invite to; If this user doesn’t have a Vrite account already, he’ll be prompted to sign up to accept the invite right after;
- _Role_ — the default role to assign to the member; If you don’t fully trust the email you’re sending the invite to, it’s recommended to set the default role to just **Viewer**;

When the form is filled out, click _Send invite_ to actually mail the invite. The new member will have up to 30 days to accept the invite before it expires.

## Customizing the Editing Experience

Vrite editor provides various formatting options and content blocks. However, when you’re writing primarily for a platform or frontend that doesn’t support all the options that Vrite does, or you’re leading a team and want to prevent the use of certain formatting, you’ll likely want to customize the available option set. You can do so in the _Editing experience_ section.

![Vrite editing experience settings](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/hP3d2KQjniIN0NwoVqZ6B.png)

Simply click to switch various formatting options and content blocks on and off. When an option is turned off, the existing content that used it will remain as-is. However, using it again, in any way — including the editing menus, shortcuts, or copy-paste — will be disabled.

### Prettier Configuration

In addition to the formatting options available, you might want to enforce a certain coding style in the code snippets. For supported languages, you can do so by configuring the built-in [Prettier](https://prettier.io) code formatter integration.

![Vrite Prettier configuration](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/uLMZmXZ_tOJwAQ98K4-FJ.png)

At the bottom of the same section, you can provide your Prettier configuration in a JSON format. Vrite supports most of [the available Prettier options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html), providing autocompletion for them in the editor, and signaling any mistakes in the configuration.

## Customizing Metadata Settings

The _Metadata_ section is where you can configure options related to content piece metadata. Right now, it enables you to set a custom pattern for a **canonical link** which will be used by default for any content piece lacking a custom canonical link. This can be useful if you’re running a publication based on Vrite and cross-post often to different frontends or platforms.

![Metadata settings section](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/bHQsixD8DlNnm-w_i5u8m.png)

## Managing Variants

_Content Piece Variants_ allow you to create and manage different alterations of your content pieces. They serve as “overlays” on top of your _Base Variant_, i.e. the piece’s default content and metadata and are great for managing multi-language content or for slightly customizing your content for different endpoints.

You can create and manage your Variants in the _Variants_ settings section.

![Variants settings section](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/R4DOfYmkxcR61c0_oIBCs.png)

The following details can be configured:

- _Label_ — label for identifying the Variant
- _Name_ — name for the Variant; You’ll be able to use it to retrieve the Content Piece Variants through the API;
- _Description_ — optional description for additional details;

![Configuring new Variant](https://assets.vrite.io/6409e82d7dfc74cef7a72e0d/HkvBrnygrWRGUMfjg35PD.png)
